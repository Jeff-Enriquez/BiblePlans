# Unity In Bible Reading
This app is so that people can join together in reading the Bible. It also has a feature for people to create their own Bible reading plans.

## Technology Used
- Angular 18.2.11

## Build and Deploy
The app is deployed through GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages uses the `main` branch `docs` folder. To build your changes for deployment, run the following command `ng build --base-href /unity-in-bible-reading/`. The base-href is needed because GitHub Pages adds the repo name to the uri.
