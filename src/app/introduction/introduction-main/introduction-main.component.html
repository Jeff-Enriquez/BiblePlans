    <h2 id="why-unity-in-bible-reading">Why Unity In Bible Reading?</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this reading plan is unity. The hope is that churches across the nation will join together in reading the Bible. There is power in unity. Joining together will present a great opportunity to sharpen one another. It will also encourage discussions about the word of God since we will be familiar with what has been recently read.</p>
    <p>The second goal of this reading plan and what makes it unique is its consistency in reading.</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-was-made">How It Was Made</h2>
    <p>When creating a reading plan the toughest decision is deciding how to divide the reading. This reading plan strives to create consistency in how much you read from day to day. The first attempt in creating this plan was to count all the words of the Bible, divide the words by the number of days in a year, then round to the nearest chapter. This provided some level of consistency but could be improved by including headings as dividing points. The next question was, “Which headings should be included?” Each Bible translation has its own set of headings. In order to remove bias, six prominent translations were chosen: CSB, ESV, NASB, NIV, NKJV, and NLT. For the New Testament, a heading was only included if at least 5 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse. The Old Testament has far fewer headings per word count and less agreement on the location of the headings. For that reason, an Old Testament heading was included if at least 3 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse.</p>
    <p>The final plan is this: the average word count of all 6 translations divided by 365, rounded to the nearest heading and/or chapter.</p>
    <h2 id="why-canonical-order">Why Canonical Order?</h2>
    <p>Most Bibles are in canonical order. Reading in this order makes it easier for people to collectively join the reading plan.</p>
    <p>The books of the Bible differ in genre, authorship, historical context, and literary style. It is easier to understand the context when reading one book at a time rather than several at a time.</p>
