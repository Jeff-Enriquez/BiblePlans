    <p>There are two goal to this reading plan. The primary goal of this reading plan is unity. The hope is that churches across the nation will join together in reading the Bible. There is power in unity. Joining together will present great opportunity to sharpen one another. It will also encourage discussions about the word of God since we will be familiar with what has been recently read.</p>
    <p>The second goal of this reading plan and what makes it unique is it's consistency. The details of that are mentioned in "How It Was Made".</p>
    <h2 name="how-it-was-made">How It Was Made</h2>
    <p>When creating a reading plan, the toughest decision is deciding how to divide the reading. Most Bible reading plans take the number of chapters and divide it by the number of days in a year. This kind of reading plan is very inconsistent. Some chapters are very short and some are very long, thus some days you will read a lot and other days very little. This reading plan strives to create consistency in how much you read from day to day. The first attempt in creating this plan was to count all the words of the Bible, divide the words by the number of days in a year, then round to the nearest chapter. While this provided more consistency than dividing by the number of chapters, it still had some large inconsistencies in the amount of reading from day to day. Since chapters alone was inefficient, headings were included as dividing points. Each Bible translation has it's own set of headings, in order to remove bias, six prominent translations were chosen: CSB, ESV, NASB, NIV, NKJV, and NLT. For the New Testament, a heading was only included if at least 5 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse. The Old Testament has far fewer headings per word count compared to the New Testament. Not only that, but there is less agreement on the location of the headings. For this reason, a heading was included in the Old Testament so long as 3 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse.</p>
    <p>The final plan is this: the average word count of all 6 translations divided by 365, rounded to the nearest heading and/or chapter.</p>
    <h2 name="why-canonical-order">Why Canonical Order?</h2>
    <p>Most Bibles are in canonical order. Reading in this order makes it easier for people to collectively join the reading plan.</p>
    <p>Reading one book at a time will give you a better understanding of the text. Jumping around between books would be like jumping around between movies. It is much easier to understand the context when reading one book at a time.</p>
    <p>The early Christians determined the order of the books of the Bible. All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16) and it stands to reason that He also inspired it's order.</p>
